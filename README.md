# Hi there, I'm Foaad Abbas 👋 

### 🚀 Software Engineering Student & Full-Stack Developer!
I am a results-driven developer and software engineering student at **Braude College of Engineering**, focused on building robust applications that bridge the gap between hardware (IoT) and high-level software. I enjoy diving deep into algorithms and ensuring my code is as efficient as it is functional.
